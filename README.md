Intro to html assignment

Practising all I have learnt so far regarding Git, Github and HTML
Going to be creating a basic recipe website using HTML5 
Going to attempt conventional Git and Github processes as well as being clean with the HTML layout

Current struggles: Wrapping head around Git's cloning, branching and commit functions


Assignment Completed:
    Feeling a lot more comfortable with Git and how cloning and commit works. Yet to do branching.
    Confidence with WSL is increasing
    Feeling good about HTMLs basics and learnt a few things such as tables 'tr' and 'td'

Completing Flexbox course with The Odin Project and Interneting is hard
New techniques developed for layout aswell as getting more and more comfortable with basic processes as of now
Git is feeling better each day and now with some practise using its tools and make a few things easier

Current struggles: Layout is still a big one, mainly how to overlap certain items ontop of one another without margins and padding breaking the page
