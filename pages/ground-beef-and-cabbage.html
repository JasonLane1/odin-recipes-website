            <h2>Ground Beef and Cabbage</h2>
            <p>This ground beef and cabbage recipe was my mother's. She was <br/>a country cook, plain and simple. But as I have traveled and worked <br/>and experienced foods from around the world, I look back and <br/>realize that many of the dishes she prepared, while simple, were <br/>perfect for that moment. Sometimes we have to put emotion and <br/>love in a dish to make it extra-special. Serve with corn on the cob <br/>and cornbread.</p>
