            <h2 class="heading">Ground Beef and Cabbage</h2>
            <p class="text">This ground beef and cabbage recipe was my mother's. She was a country cook, plain and simple. But as I have traveled and worked and experienced foods from around the world, I look back and realize that many of the dishes she prepared, while simple, were perfect for that moment. Sometimes we have to put emotion and love in a dish to make it extra-special. Serve with corn on the cob and cornbread.</p>
